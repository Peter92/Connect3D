# Connect 3D
Many years ago I came up with a simple game to kill time in English lessons, and I finally decided to code it.

It's like a 3D version of Connect 4 crossed with Noughts and Crosses (or Tic Tac Toe for you Americans), where after every 3 goes, the grid will flip, so that people solely good at planning ahead do not win every time. The game ends after all spaces are filled, and the player with the most points wins.

You may play against a friend, the computer, or watch two computer players battle it out. There are difficulty settings, ranging from 'beginner' to 'extreme', which determine what the computer notices and how often it'll change its priorities. To stop super easy points, the chance of not noticing something is reduced to start with, since it is very easy to see when the opposing player nearly has a point.
