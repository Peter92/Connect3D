# Connect3D
Connect3D is based off a game I came up many years ago to kill time in english lessons. 

It's like a 3D version of Connect 4 crossed with Noughts and Crosses (or Tic Tac Toe for you Americans), where also after every 3 goes the grid will flip, to give people with good spacial awareness a chance against people good at planning ahead. The game ends after all spaces are filled, and the player with the most points wins.

You may play against a friend, the computer, or watch two computer players battle it out. There are difficulty settings, ranging from 'easy' to 'extreme', but I've tried to make it so it still won't let you get easy points.

Soon I'll attempt to make it properly draw a GUI, so you won't have to enter the coordinates.
