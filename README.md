# Connect 3D
Many years ago at school during English lessons I came up with a simple game to pass the time, and I've finally ended up coding it.

It's like a 3D version of Connect 4 crossed with Noughts and Crosses (or Tic Tac Toe), where after every 3 goes, the grid will flip to mix things up a bit, so that people only really good at planning ahead do not win every time. The game ends after either all spaces are filled or no remaining points are left, and the player with the most points wins.

You may play against a friend, the computer, or watch multiple computer players battle it out. There are difficulty settings, ranging from 'beginner' to 'extreme', which determine what the computer notices and how often it'll change its priorities.
