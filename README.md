# Connect 3D
Many years ago I came up with a simple game to kill time during English lessons, and I finally decided to code it.

It's like a 3D version of Connect 4 crossed with Noughts and Crosses/Tic Tac Toe, where after every 3 goes, the grid will flip, so that people only really good at planning ahead do not win every time. The game ends after either all spaces are filled or no remaining points are left, and the player with the most points wins.

You may play against a friend, the computer, or watch two computer players battle it out. There are difficulty settings, ranging from 'beginner' to 'extreme', which determine what the computer notices and how often it'll change its priorities.
